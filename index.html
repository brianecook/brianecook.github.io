        Hello! My name is Brian Cook. I've spent the last 7 years focused on writing clean, scalable code for highly trafficked online stores, websites, and web apps. After spending 4 years working in agencies an startups in Colorado and San Diego, I am currently living in Billings, Montana, while I support my fianc&eacute; as she completes her residency in naturopathic medicine.

        Below are a few projects I've been lucky to be a part of. The code is all my own. Click around and enjoy! Let me know if you have any questions or feedback at <a href="mailto:brianecook@gmail.com">brianecook@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!
